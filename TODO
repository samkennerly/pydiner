ASAP:
  - bin/scrambled
  - delete old scripts
  - double-check .gitignore
  - simplify tests. move tmp/ outside test/ folder.
  - autoformat with Black
  - finish README
  - release 1.0.0

KITCHEN:
  - Dockerfile build-arg in FROM? (need it for Python version)
  - build multiple images: pydiner:latest, pydiner:3.4, ...
  - kitchen commands must accept a tag (default 'latest')

FUTURE:
  - flask example
  - utensils: adjust for different Python versions?
  - timeit: speed trials?
  - mypy: type hints?
