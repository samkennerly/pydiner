# pydiner

Snakes on a plate.

## abstract

Pydiner is a [template]() for a generic Python project which:

- runs code in [containers]() which [self-destruct]()
- never installs software outside of its own Docker [images]()
- never uses or modifies other Pythons, [Anaconda](), or [virtualenvs]()
- updates `requirements.txt` with [pinned versions]() of installed packages

These rules are intended to minimize time spent in [dependency hell]().

## basics

To start a new project:

1. Generate a new repo [from this template]().
2. Edit the `Dockerfile` to choose a Python version and system packages.
3. Edit `requirements.txt` to choose Python packages to install with `pip`.
4. Open a terminal, `cd` to this folder, and run this command:
```sh
./kitchen help
```

### mise en python

Pydiner's [kitchen](kitchen) defines [shell functions]() for running [development containers]().
```sh
# Build a Docker image named pydiner:monty
./kitchen bake monty

# Update requirements.txt and rebuild pydiner:monty
./kitchen freeze monty

# Run Python in a container with $PWD mounted as /context
./kitchen serve monty python

# Run automated tests without mounting any folders
./kitchen runit monty python -m test

# Show which files were baked into the `pydiner:latest` image.
./kitchen runit latest tree

# Delete the image, its containers, and any leftovers
./kitchen eightysix monty
```
Typing `./kitchen` before each command is not necessary if the kitchen is [sourced]().

### baking images

Baking a `pydiner` image copies files from the the [build context]() into the image.

- Inside a container, these <q>baked-in</q> copies will appear in the `/context` folder.
- Each `pydiner` container gets its own independent copy of the `/context` folder.
- Edit `.dockerignore` to declare file patterns which should never be copied.
- Edit `Dockerfile` to choose which non-ignored files are copied into images.

Modifying a baked-in copy does **not** affect the original file.

### freezing packages

Freezing an image runs `pip freeze` and saves the output to `requirements.txt`.

- When a `pydiner` image is first baked, it uses `pip` to install requirements.
- Subsequent bakes often skip using `pip` if `requirements.txt` is unchanged.
- If versions are not [pinned](), then baking might not produce [reproducible builds]().
- Running `freeze` enables `pip` to install the same package versions every time.

Freezing **overwrites** anything that was in `requirements.txt`.

### serving with fresh files

Serving an image runs a new container with the current folder [mounted]() as `/context`.

- Images are [immutable](). Rebuilding is the only way to update baked-in files.
- For development work, rebuilding after every minor code edit can be impractical.
- Mounting folders gives a container read and write access to the original files.
- Any files baked into `/context` will be [shadowed]() by these <q>fresh</q> files.

Mounts are **not** copies. If a mounted file dies in a container, it dies in the real world.

## contents

Pydiner includes short examples of common project ingredients:

- [bin/](bin) contains executable scripts.
- [etc/](etc) contains configuration files.
- [src/](src) contains an importable [package]().
- [test/](test) is an [executable package]() which runs tests.
- [var/](var) contains files output by the script(s).

The [folder structure]() is loosely based on a C++ template from [hiltmon.com](https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/07/03/a-simple-c-plus-plus-project-structure/).

## dependencies

Pydiner does not require Python. It has one dependency:

- Docker for [Linux]() or [Mac]() or [Windows]()

Windows users may need to edit the [kitchen]() script for [path compatibility]().

## examples

Remember to `cd` to this folder before running any `kitchen` commmands.

Bake, freeze, and serve `bash` with the default name `pydiner:latest`.
```sh
./kitchen bake && ./kitchen freeze && ./kitchen serve
```

Serving `bash` makes the container act like a real Linux machine.
```sh
root@pydiner:/context# which python
/usr/local/bin/python
root@pydiner:/context# grep PRETTY_NAME /etc/os-release
PRETTY_NAME="Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)"
root@pydiner:/context#
```

Run Python and `import pydiner` without hacking [sys.path]().
```sh
root@pydiner:/context# python
Python 3.7.4 (default, Jul 13 2019, 14:04:11)
[GCC 8.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import pydiner
>>> pydiner.echo("Hello, World!")
2019-08-24 22:35:05 Hello, World!
>>> exit()
root@pydiner:/context#
```

Scripts in the project's `bin` folder are on the system [PATH]().
```sh
root@pydiner:/context# scrambled eggs
2019-12-03 21:36:55 Write derangements of 'eggs' to STDOUT
2019-12-03 21:36:55 10 expected

2019-12-03 21:36:55 0:00:00.000116 time elapsed
root@pydiner:/context#
```

Save the output of a script.
```sh
root@pydiner:/context# scrambled -o var/dirtyfork.txt dirtyfork
2019-12-03 21:42:07 Write derangements of 'dirtyfork' to /context/var/dirtyfork.txt
2019-12-03 21:42:07 145152 expected
2019-12-03 21:42:07 101976 found
2019-12-03 21:42:07 0:00:00.632822 time elapsed
root@pydiner:/context#
```

Exit the container.
```sh
root@pydiner:/context# exit
```

Look inside the `var` folder. Is the output file real, or was it all just a dream?

## faq

### Let me out of this thing!

Hit *CTRL-D* to exit a container.

### How do I install PyDiner?

Don't. Use it as a [template]() for a new repository.

### Can I run containers in the background?

Yes, but not with the `kitchen` script.
See the [Docker run reference]().

### Do I have to run as root inside a container?

Not if you create a `USER`. See the [Dockerfile reference] for details.

### What testing framework does `pydiner` use?

None, but it has been tested with [pytest]() to ensure compatibility.

### What logging framework does `pydiner` use?

[None](https://12factor.net/logs).
Calling `achtung()` prints to `STDERR`.
Calling `echo()` prints to `STDOUT`.
