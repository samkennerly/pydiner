# pydiner

Snakes on a plate.

## abstract

Pydiner is a [template]() for a generic Python project which:

- runs code in [containers]() which [self-destruct]() after exiting
- never modifies other Pythons, [Anaconda](), or [virtualenvs]()
- never installs anything outside of its own Docker [images]()
- declares all required Python packages in `requirements.txt`
- declares all required system packages in a `Dockerfile`

These rules are intended to minimize time spent in [dependency hell]().

## basics

To start a new project:

1. Generate a new repo [from this template]().
2. Delete files you don't need. Add any files you want.
3. Edit the `Dockerfile` to choose a Python version and system packages.
4. Edit `requirements.txt` to choose Python packages to install with `pip`.
5. Run `./kitchen help` to see available commands and Docker objects.

Open a terminal, `cd` to this folder, and run these commands:
```
# Build a pydiner:dirty image
./kitchen bake dirty

# Update requirements.txt and rebuild pydiner:dirty
./kitchen freeze dirty

# Run all tests in a pydiner:latest container
./kitchen runit dirty python -m test

# Run a pydiner:dirty container, mount $PWD, and run a script
./kitchen serve dirty scrambled eggs

# Delete the image, container, and any leftovers
./kitchen eightysix dirty
```
Scroll down for more examples.

## contents

Pydiner includes small examples of common Python project ingredients:

- [bin/](bin) contains the `scrambled` script.
- [etc/](etc) contains configuration files for the script.
- [src/](src) contains the `pydiner` [package]().
- [test/](test) contains automated [unit tests]() for the package.
- The [kitchen]()kitchen script builds and runs [development containers]().

Pydiner's [folder structure]() is loosely based on a C++ template from [hiltmon.com](https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/07/03/a-simple-c-plus-plus-project-structure/).

The `kitchen` script contains [shell functions]() including:

- `./kitchen bake` builds (or rebuilds) a `pydiner:latest` Docker image.
- `./kitchen freeze` updates `requirements.txt` with [pinned versions]().
- `./kitchen serve` runs a `pydiner` container and [mounts]() the current folder.
- `./kitchen clean` deletes all `pydiner` containers and Docker [leftovers]().

Typing `./kitchen` is not necessary if the `kitchen` script is [sourced]().

### bake images

Processes in a `pydiner` container have two ways to access files on your computer:

- `./kitchen bake` copies the [build context]() into an image's `/context` folder.
- `./kitchen serve` [mounts]() the current working folder as `/context`.

Docker ignores files which match patterns in the [.dockerignore](.dockerignore) file.
Everything else in this repository is copied into each `pydiner` image.
Each `pydiner` container gets an independent copy of these <q>baked-in</q> files.
Containers can read, write and delete their own `/context` files without fear of damaging the originals.

Files baked into an image do **not** update themselves when the originals change.

### freeze packages

Each time you bake an image, Docker checks if `requirements.txt` has changed.
If so, then it uses [pip]() to install all packages and their dependencies.
(See the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) for details.)

Run `./kitchen freeze` if you need to know *exactly* what was installed,
or you want [reproducible builds]() for your project.
Docker will run `pip freeze`, save the output, and rebuild the image.

Freezing **overwrites** anything that was in `requirements.txt`.

### serve containers

Images are [immutable]().
Files copied into images do not update when the originals change.

Run `./kitchen serve` to run a container with access to the original files.
Docker will [bind mount]() the current working folder as `/context`.
Files <q>baked</q> into `/context` will be [shadowed]() by these <q>fresh</q> files.

Mounted files are **not** copies.
If a mounted file dies in a container, it dies in the real world.

### clean everything

Run `exit` or hit *CTRL-D* to exit a container.
Pydiner containers [self-destruct]() when they exit.

## dependencies

- Docker for [Linux]() or [Mac]() or [Windows]()

Windows users may need to edit the [kitchen]() script for [path compatibility]().

## examples (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

If everything worked, your terminal should look like this:
```bash
Successfully tagged pydiner:latest
Total reclaimed space: 0B
root@pydiner:/context#
```

Each `pydiner` container acts like a real Linux machine:
```bash
root@pydiner:/context# which python
/usr/local/bin/python
root@pydiner:/context# grep PRETTY_NAME /etc/os-release
PRETTY_NAME="Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)"
```
Project files are in the `/context` folder:
```bash
root@pydiner:/context# ls
Dockerfile  LICENSE  README.md  TODO.txt  bin  etc  kitchen  requirements.txt  setup.py  src  test  var
```
Packages in [requirements.txt] and [setup.py] have been installed:
```bash
root@pydiner:/context# flake8
./test/test_utensils.py:15:26: E203 whitespace before ':'
```
The `pydiner` package can be imported without hacking [sys.path]:
```bash
root@pydiner:/context# python
Python 3.7.4 (default, Jul 13 2019, 14:04:11)
[GCC 8.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import pydiner
>>> pydiner.echo("Hello, World!")
2019-08-24 22:35:05 Hello, World!
```
Scripts in the project's [bin/] folder are on the system [PATH]:
```bash
root@pydiner:/context# soda --fizz 2 --buzz 3 1 10
1 Fizz  Buzz  Fizz  5 FizzBuzz  7 Fizz  Buzz
```

## faq (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

### How do I install PyDiner?

Don't. Use it as a [template]() for a new repository.

### Can I run containers in the background?

The `kitchen` script only runs [interactive] containers.
See the [Docker run reference] for other options.

### Do I have to run as root inside a container?

Not if you create a `USER`. See the [Dockerfile reference] for details.

### What testing framework does `pydiner` use?

None. The [test] folder is an [executable package]. To run all tests:
```bash
# from the top-level repo folder
./kitchen serve latest python -m test

# from inside a container
python -m test
```
When possible, `pydiner` tries to follow [pytest] conventions.

### What logging framework does `pydiner` use?

None. Messages are [streamed](https://12factor.net/logs) and never saved.
`achtung()` prints errors to `STDERR`.
`echo()` prints logs to `STDOUT`.
